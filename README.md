# GeneticSnakeAI
Genetic Algorithm for optimizing Snake

I actually did not make most of this.  i got the original code from here https://github.com/emgoz/Neural-network-snake.  

When you run the exe you might have to manually bypass your antivirus as i have not signed it. The exe also requires java 1.8.0

using the GUI you can tweak parameters, in order for you tweaks to take affect you have to reset you training.  

You can enter whatever you want in the text fields, but i have not built in any limts or stuff.  So don't go insane with like the number of snakes or something.  

I hope you find this usefull.
