# GeneticSnakeAI
Genetic Algorithm for optimizing Snake

I actually did not make most of this.  i got the original code from here https://github.com/emgoz/Neural-network-snake.  

When you run the  Genetic Snake AI exe you might have to manually bypass your antivirus as i have not signed it. The exe also requires java 1.8.0. 
I made a installer with actual installer (hence the installerconfig.aip file) that  you can use to easily install it on your computer.  Again, not signed, as this
project is not worth the $500 hassel to me, so you will have to brave the windows thing that says it is from an unknown publisher.  :)

using the GUI you can tweak parameters, in order for you tweaks to take affect you have to reset you training.  

You can enter whatever you want in the text fields, but i have not built in any limts or stuff.  So don't go insane with like the number of snakes or something.  
IF YOU GET A JNI ERROR THEN YOU NEED TO GO AND REINSTALL THE LATEST VERSION OF JAVA

go to https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk17-windows and download/install the appropriate software
I hope you find this usefull.
